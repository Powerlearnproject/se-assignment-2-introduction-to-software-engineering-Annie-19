# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Is a systematic approach to design, developing, testing and maintaining software
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
It is a systematic approach to design, developing, testing and maintaining software
Programming is centred around coding while software engineering is extended over the entire life of software
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Planning and analysis- In this phase you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production and the needs of the users.
2. Define requirements- In this phase, the information collected during the planning and analysis period is converted into clear requirements for the development team.
3. Design- This is where the developers come up with the best architecture for the software.
4. Development- In this phase, the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirements into codes that makes the product.
5. Testing- The development team performs validation testing to make sure the system is functioning properly.
6. Deployment- The development team delivers the final product to the user.
7. Maintainance- This refers to the supervision of the product and improving in needed areas
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model refers to a group of development processes that have some similar characteristics and some subtle differences among themselves while waterfall model has a simple structure and is easier to use and providestangible output. 
Agile is suitable for projects requiring flexibility and constant requirement changes while waterfall is best for projects with well-defined stages and straight-forward, linear requirements.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is the process of identifying, eliciting, analysing, specifying, validating and managing needs and expectations of stakeholders for a softare system.
process:
1. Feasibility study-
2. Requirement elicitation- It is the process of gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
3. Requirement specification- It is the process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent, and unambigous manner.
4. Requirements verification and validation- Verification refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function, while validation refers to different set of tasks that ensures the software that has been built is traceable to a customers requirements.
5. Requirements management- is the process of managing the requirements throughout the software development life cycle including tracking and controlling changes, and ensuring that the requirements are still valid and relevant.
It identifies, analyses, documents and validates the needs of software users, providing a roadmap for the development team and ensuring everyone works towards a common goal.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It refers to the logical partitioning of the software design that allows complex software to be managable for the purpose of implementation and maintainance.
It improves maintainability and scalability of software systems by breaking down software into independent modules
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing- Errors are detected individually from every component by testing the components of software to ensure that they are fit for use by developers.
2. Intergration testing- In this testing ,two or more modules which are unit tested are intergrated to test and are then verified if this intergrated modules work as per expectations or not,and interface errors are also detected.
3. System testing- All the system elements forming the system are tested as whole to meet the requirements of the system.
4. Acceptance testing- It is conducted to ensure that the requirements of the user are fullfilled before its delivery.
Testing is crucial in software development because it improves consistency and performance.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control system are category of software development tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
They are important because they keep track on changes made on a particular software and take snapshot of every modification.
1.Git- Features:
-Toolkit- based design
-Distributed repository method
-Provides a strong support for non-linear development
2.CVS- Features:
-Anonymous read access
-Keeps a historical snapshot of the project
-Excludes symbolic links to avoid a security risk
3.Mercurial- Features:
-High performance and scalability
-Advanced branching and merging capabilities.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager is to be responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resource to help complete the project.
Responsibilities in managing software projects:
-To discuss new projects and proposals with clients,collegues and other stakeholders
-Managing project progress to ensure projects stay on schedule
Challenges in managing software projects:
-Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines
-Lack of accountability
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance refers to the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with the customers needs.
Types:
1.Corrective maintenance- Involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system
2.Patching- An emergiency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management
3.Adaptive maintenance- Involves modifying the software system to adapt it to the changes in the environment
4.Perfective maintenance- Involves improving functionality, performance and reliability and restructuring the software system to improve changeability
5.Preventive maintenance- Involves taking measures to prevent future problems
It is essential because it does all the software modifications in software applications so as to improve performance.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues:
-Privacy
-Data collection
-Algorithmic bias
-Data security
-Addictive design
Software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work by being truthful about their qualifications, capabilities and the potential impact of their work.
